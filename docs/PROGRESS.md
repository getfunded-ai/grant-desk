# Progress

Living status. Every agent updates its own phase row and its own session-log lines after every task.

## Session log

- 2026-10-31: Repository published with a clean history. Phase A complete. Phases B and C started.
- 2026-10-31: Phase B rebased onto the public history. Fifteen tables, row-level security on all of
  them, 262 migration and RLS tests (PGlite and the local Supabase stack), three review rounds. Nothing
  applied to the hosted database yet; that waits for the maintainer after merge.
